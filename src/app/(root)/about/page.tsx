          My first time programming was in 7th grade when I was a graphic design
          major. That is when I created my first simple website using HTML, CSS,
          and JavaScript.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">The Detour</h2>
          <p>
            In highschool, I took quite the detour and decided to major in
            Orchestra where I played Cello and Piano.
          </p>
          <p>
            After many years of travelling to perform, concerts, and recitals, I
            decided to pick up my passion of technology again in college, and
            majored in Computer Science.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="space-y-1 md:text-lg">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Rediscovering Code</h2>
          <p>
            My journey wasn&apos;t easy. After a rough first year struggling
            with C and C++, I switched my major to Political Science.
          </p>
          <p>
            It didn&apos;t take long for me to realize I enjoyed math and
            problem-solving a lot more than writing essays.
          </p>
          <p>
            I transferred from UNR to UNLV, switched back to Computer Science,
            and surprisingly, my first assembly class reignited my passion for
            coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            While studying, I explored new technologies on my own and built
            projects using Python and JavaScript.

        <div className="space-y-1 md:text-lg">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Building with Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            This self-driven learning eventually led me to pursue real-world
            impact through tech.
          </p>
          <p>
            I built a website for a non-profit organization, tutored students as
            a private tutor, became an undergraduate teaching assistant,
            revamped my fraternity&apos;s website and most recently, started
            developing Easy Tagalog which is a language-learning app designed to
            reconnect with my heritage and help others do the same.
